FLATEARTHLING NIGHTMARE


This is a canvas based game, where a FLATEARTHLING will have to dodge falling science books, terrestrial globes and Pythagoras figures and try to catch some Newton apples in order to recover a little of life. In this game, if you loose you win. There is a limited time to play.
